### 1. Prepare the datasets.


- (1) SYSU-MM01 Dataset [1]: The SYSU-MM01 dataset can be downloaded from this [website](http://isee.sysu.edu.cn/project/RGBIRReID.htm).

- run `python pre_process_sysu.py` to pepare the dataset, the training data will be stored in ".npy" format.


- (2) RegDB Dataset [2]: The RegDB dataset can be downloaded from this [website](http://dm.dongguk.edu/link.html) by submitting a copyright form.

- (Named: "Dongguk Body-based Person Recognition Database (DBPerson-Recog-DB1)" on their website). 

- A private download link can be requested via sending an email to mangye16@gmail.com. 

- (3) LLCM Dataset [3]: The LLCM dataset can be downloaded from this [website](https://github.com/ZYK100/LLCM) by submitting a copyright form.
- Please send a signed dataset release agreement copy to zhangyk@stu.xmu.edu.cn

### 2. Training and Testing.
Before train the hos-net, you can download the baseline ckpt from [CAJ](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/107vztbRqim8-oQAuEBh_9S8oTKdhuV2j?usp=sharing) and put it in `./baseline/`  The results might be better by finetuning the hyper-parameters.


```bash
python train_hos_net.py
```

ckpt and log can be seen in `./sle_ckpt/`, `./sle_hsl_ckpt/`, and `./sle_hsl_cfl_ckpt/`
